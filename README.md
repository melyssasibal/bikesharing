# Tableau - Citi Bike Data

## Project Overview 

This project uses Tableau to look at August 2019 Citi Bike data in New York City. The project aims to provide insight into how a similar business model could be replicated in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Results 

**Number of Trips in Data**

The visualization shows the total number (2,344,244) of trips recorded within the dataset that will be analyzed further. As mentioned in the overview, this is a datasest of all New York City records for the month of August 2019. Given this is a summer month and in New York City, this is probably a busy time of year with tourists and students on their summer vacations. The visualization contextualizes the sample size, as well as provides a quantitative idea of the utilization of Citi Bike in New York City. 

**Customer Types**

The visualization is a pie chart of the count of trips by customer type: annual subscribers or one-time customers. From the data, over half of the recorded trips are from subscribers. Despite the data being from a popular tourist and vacation month, it seems that the majority of customers will be repeat customers. 

**Trip Durations**

The visualization illustrates the trip durations by the count of rides. The x-axis shows the duration in minutes, which is further blocked into hours. As illustrated, there are few records that go beyond 1 hour, which may be related to the pricing structure. From the graph, it seems like a majority of customer trip durations are under 20 minutes. The highest number of customers have a trip duration of 4.67 minutes.

**Trip Duration by Gender**

Similarly to the previous graph, the visualization shows the trip durations by the ride count. However, this is disaggregated by gender. As can been seen, males seems to account for more of the sample than females. Additionally, the maximum trip duration for males is higher than for females. Contrastly, the highest number of male customers have a trip duration of 5.13 minutes, while the highest number of female customers have a trip duration of 6.05 minutes. 

**Trips by Day per Hour**

The heat map depicts the day and hour of use by the ride count. The ride count is demonstrated through the color density. Looking at the darker areas of the map, most bikes are used during the weekdays from 6AM-10AM and 4PM-8PM. Saturdays from 10AM-8PM have a high usage as well. Sundays have high use between 10AM-8PM, but not as many rides compared to Saturdays. Wednesday evenings seem to be not as popular in comparison to the rest of the weekdays. Thursdays seem to be the most popular during 7AM-9AM and 5PM-8PM. Thursdays and Fridays are also slightly busier from 12PM-4PM than the other weekdays.  

**Trips by Day per Hour by Gender**
![6](/images/6.png)
The heat maps shows the day and hour of use by the ride count by gender. As seen in the trip duration by gender graph, males make up a large portion of the sample, as the boxes are darker than the female and unknown group. The trands for each gender follow similar patterns to the trips by day per hour heat map. 

**Trips by Day by Gender and User Type**
![7](/images/7.png)
This heat map depicts trips by day, gender and user type. Male and female subscribers account for a high percentage of trips on every day of the week in contrast to the other groups, with male subscribers the vast majority. Thursdays and Fridays seem to have the highest ride count for both male and female subscribers. 

## Summary 

From the Citi Bike data, it can be inferred that this business model can be sustaining and may not depend on a tourist economy to survive. Based on popular times for trips, the best times for repairs and maintence would be in the early mornings or late nights. 

While this data offers some insight into how a similar business model could be successful in Des Moines, further research and analysis should be conducted. It may be beneficial, if possible, to investigate the following: 
- **Trip duration by user type:** Are subscribers using Citi Bikes for longer durations than one-time customers? Or is the opposite true? 
- **Age bracket by user type:** What are the ages of customers? Does Des Moines have a similar demographics? 

**Qualitative data:** 
- What is the popular means of transport currently in Des Moines? What does Des Moines city intrastructure look like? Are roads safe for bikes? Public transportation in New York City is popular and therefore, New Yorkers are open to different means of transportation, especially since most do not own cars. Citi Bike offers an additional source of transportation, but also it is supported by the city infrastructure.  
- Why are people using Citi Bike (work, school, etc.)? Are there similar needs in Des Moines?
